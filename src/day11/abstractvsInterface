Q3) Explain the difference between abstract class and interface.
A3) abstract class is partially implemented class where interface is fully unimplemented class.
in abstract class there is abstract method and normal method also .but in Interface there is only abstract method.
in abstract class we can declare variables too but in Interface we have to declare variable with final static keyword
only and also have to initialize with suitable value.
with the help of Interface we can achieve full encapsulation.
abstract class support only single inheritance whereas Interface supports multiple inheritance.
abstract class can extend to java class and  implement interface both whereas interface only implement to interface only
